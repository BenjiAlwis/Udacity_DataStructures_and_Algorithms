Problem 6:
In this solution, two placeholders for the maximum and minimum values are used. Traversal is sequential and done only once. It does not have to be a sorted list since the aim is to sequentially identify the minimum and maximum values. Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of items in the list and the space complexity is O(1).
