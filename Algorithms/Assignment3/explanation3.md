Problem 3:
This problem had to be solved with a time complexity of O(n*log(n)). I implemented it as a merge sort problem and ordered the list accordingly. Once sorted I constructed the two numbers taking digits in order from the sorted list and then assigning them to the two numbers in an alternating fashion. The space complexity of this algorithm was O(n).
