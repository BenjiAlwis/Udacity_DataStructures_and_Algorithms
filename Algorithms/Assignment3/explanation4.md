Problem 4:
Since this problem had to be solved in one iteration, I conceptually divided the array into three sets. The first set for zeros, the second set for ones and the third set for twos. Sequentially each value in the list was checked for either 0 or 2 and moved to the appropriate ends. This left the 1s in the middle and it was arranged in a single traversal. Time complexity was exactly O(n) and space complexity was ((1).
