Problem 1:
This algorithm adopts an approach that can be called a variant of binary search. In doing this, it checks whether the square of the midpoint value is greater or smaller than the item that we want to get the square root. Based on this outcome it determines which half of the items it should use in a recursive fashion. Similar to a binary search algorithm, time complexity of O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(1).
